2. Why You picked this tutorial?
I Chose this one because it offered me something new to learn. I haven't worked on any 3d run-time mesh building game so that's why I chose it.

3. What was hard part?
Understanding how we can create the mesh, mathematical calculations  for vertices was a challenge for me

4. What did you learn from it?
Creating mesh at run time

5. What new did you added to game? (bonus)

1: different difficulity level (3 different speeds, speed change when plsyer reaches to a score of 1000 and than 5000)
2: effects on speeds
3: player life (Previously it was 1)
4: effects while it hits hurdle, now it turns red that informs user with which hurdle he got hit.
